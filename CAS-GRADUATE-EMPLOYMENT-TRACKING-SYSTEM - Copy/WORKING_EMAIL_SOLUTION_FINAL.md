# Final Working Email Solution

## The Problem:
EmailJS is not sending emails to user's email addresses, only to your account.

## The Solution:
Let's use a different approach that will definitely work.

## Option 1: Use Resend (Recommended - 2 minutes setup)

1. **Go to [Resend.com](https://resend.com/)**
2. **Sign up for free account**
3. **Get your API key**
4. **Replace the email function** with Resend API

## Option 2: Use SMTP.js (Works immediately)

1. **Go to [SMTP.js](https://smtpjs.com/)**
2. **Get your SMTP credentials**
3. **Update the code** to use SMTP.js

## Option 3: Use Current System with Manual Process

The current system works, but requires manual forwarding:

1. **User requests reset**
2. **You receive email** with the code
3. **You forward the code** to the user
4. **User enters code** to reset password

## Quick Fix - Test EmailJS First:

1. **Go to**: `http://localhost:8000/test_emailjs.html`
2. **Click "Test EmailJS"**
3. **Check your Gmail inbox**
4. **If you receive the email, EmailJS is working!**

## If EmailJS Still Fails:

I can implement a different email service that will definitely send emails to users. The most reliable options are:

1. **Resend** - Modern email API
2. **SendGrid** - Enterprise email service
3. **SMTP.js** - Simple SMTP solution

## Current Status:
- ‚ùå EmailJS not sending to user emails
- ‚úÖ Web3Forms working (sends to your email)
- üîß Need to implement different email service

## Next Steps:
1. Test the EmailJS test page first
2. If it fails, I'll implement a different email service
3. The system will work either way!
