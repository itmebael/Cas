# Quick Email Setup - Fix "No Email Receive" Issue

## Problem Fixed ✅
Your system was not actually sending emails. The old code used Supabase's reset link system, not 6-digit codes.

## Solution: Choose One Email Service

### Option 1: Web3Forms (Recommended - 2 minutes)

1. **Go to [Web3Forms.com](https://web3forms.com/)**
2. **Get your access key** (free, no signup required)
3. **Open `script.js`** and find line 3859
4. **Replace** `YOUR_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` with your actual key:
   ```javascript
   access_key: 'your-actual-access-key-here',
   ```
5. **Test immediately** - emails will be sent to your inbox

### Option 2: EmailJS (5 minutes)

1. **Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)**
2. **Sign up for free account**
3. **Connect your Gmail**
4. **Create email template** with this content:
   ```
   Subject: Password Reset Code
   
   Your password reset code is: {{reset_code}}
   
   This code expires in 15 minutes.
   ```
5. **Update `script.js`** with your credentials:
   - Line 3885: Replace `YOUR_EMAILJS_USER_ID`
   - Line 3887: Replace `YOUR_SERVICE_ID`
   - Line 3888: Replace `YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID`

## Test It Now (Works Immediately)

Even without setting up email services, the system works:

1. **Go to forgot password screen**
2. **Enter any email** (like `test@example.com`)
3. **Click "Send Reset Code"**
4. **Check browser console** (F12) for the 6-digit code
5. **Enter that code** on the website

## What You'll See

**With email service configured:**
- ✅ "Reset code sent! Check your email for the 6-digit reset code"

**Without email service:**
- ⚠️ "Email services not configured. Check browser console (F12) for your reset code"
- The 6-digit code appears in browser console

## Current Status
- ✅ System generates 6-digit codes
- ✅ System stores codes for verification
- ✅ System works immediately for testing
- ⚠️ Email delivery requires Web3Forms or EmailJS setup

## Next Steps
1. Set up Web3Forms (2 minutes) or EmailJS (5 minutes)
2. Test with real email addresses
3. Enjoy working password reset system!
